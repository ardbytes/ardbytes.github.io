This post documents my journey of learning the C programming language.

This Wookash podcast about [Deciding the fate of the C language][dc] is good. I
particularly liked the discussions about [C Macros][cm] and their answers to
[questions][qa] by community members. Both Ryan and Ginger recommend reading the
code written by John Carmack, especially Quake 2 and Doom 3.

Many people have recommended the [Advice for Writing Small Programs in C][adv]
talk by Sean Barrett. I plan to read his collection of single file libraries.

The same set of people have also recommended [Handmade Hero][hh]. I plan to
purchase the source code and read it.

I have been following Antirez's [Course on Programming in C][ac] on YouTube and
recommend it.

[Beej's Guide to C][bg] is regularly cited on X.com, so I have to read that.

I also plan to read the [Netdata][nd] codebase, since it would be useful at work.
