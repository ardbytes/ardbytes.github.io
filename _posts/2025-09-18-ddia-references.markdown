One of the good things about The DDIA book is the References section at the end
of each chapter. This blog post documents my notes on reading some of the
refered items.

### Chapter 1: Reliable Scalable and Maintainable Applications

The [Principles of Software Engineering, Part 1][pose-p1] post by Nathan Marz
discusses how Engineering is different from Programming. In Programming, the
set of inputs are deterministic. In Engineering, they are not. A big part of
being a good Engineer is having the ability to anticipate different conditions
that the system would be subjected to and build capabilities in the system to
handle such conditions gracefully.
