Karpathy posted [this][kv] video on his YouTube channel. One hour into watching it, I liked the way he presented the concept of base model inference. With just a base model
he was able to get it to provide translations of English words to Korean by giving patterns and let it fill the missing information.

Another thing I started was reading the [AI Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098166302) book by Chip. After reading the first chapter, I liked the style of writing
and look forward to read the whole book.

I had also started reading [Build A LLM From Scratch][llmfs] by [@rasbt](https://github.com/rasbt) and have been taking notes [here][llmr].

One more thing! Ben Thompson [interviewed][bti] the CEO of ServiceNow regarding Enterprise AI Agents. Hopefully, I will get to it this weekend ( 8-9th Feb 2025 ).
